#Structure Of Class
*******************
class classname
{
    private:
        datamembers;
        memberfunctions;
    public:
        datamembers;
        memberfunctions;

}

#Creating Instance Of Class
***************************

Classname obj_name;

with this obj_name we can access class members(datamembers and memberfunctions)
*we cannot access private data members and member functions using objects(instances)
*if member function defination is inside class then it is by default inline function
