# OOPS_CONCEPT_C++

### Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. `The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.`

# Classes And Objects

- The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a `Class`.
- It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
- A class is like a blueprint for an object.
- `Object`: An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

## `Structure Of Class`

```
class A-Structure_Of_Class
{
private:
    /* data */
public:
    A-Structure_Of_Class(/* args */);
    ~A-Structure_Of_Class();
};

A-Structure_Of_Class::A-Structure_Of_Class(/* args */)
{
}

A-Structure_Of_Class::~A-Structure_Of_Class()
{
}
```
